# Main Solver Experiment

`main_solver` is the first non-agentic experiment scaffold.

It runs benchmark-grouped solvers through the public solver contract:

```bash
./setup.sh
./solve.sh <case_dir> <config_dir> <solution_dir>
```

The experiment owns run selection, result layout, verification, and aggregation.
Solvers own implementation details and may use any language behind their shell
entrypoints.

Unlike agentic runs, traditional solver entries are benchmark-specific. The
experiment therefore keeps one solver-centered config:

```text
experiments/main_solver/
├── config.yaml
└── solvers/
```

Each solver profile carries the benchmark name, case list or reported metrics,
and executable verifier command when the solver is runnable.

## Evidence Types

Rows keep an explicit `evidence_type`:

- `reproduced_solver`: runnable solver output verified by a benchmark verifier
- `fixture_backed_lookup`: runnable lookup output verified by a benchmark verifier
- `citation_reported`: non-runnable metrics copied from cited literature

Do not merge these categories in reporting without preserving the label.

## Usage

Preview selected jobs:

```bash
uv run python experiments/main_solver/run.py --dry-run
```

Run a smoke case:

```bash
uv run python experiments/main_solver/run.py \
    --benchmark spot5 \
    --solver spot5_reference_lookup \
    --case test/8
```

Materialize SatNet citation-backed rows:

```bash
uv run python experiments/main_solver/run.py \
    --benchmark satnet \
    --solver satnet_milp_claudet2022
```

Aggregate results:

```bash
uv run python experiments/main_solver/aggregate.py
```

## Result Layout

```text
results/main_solver/<benchmark>/<solver>/<case_slug>/
├── config/
├── solution/
├── logs/
└── run.json
```

Runnable rows include setup, solve, and verifier sections. Citation-reported
rows include reported metrics and provenance instead of execution logs.

Benchmark verifiers are consumed as executables. The runner does not import
benchmark-internal functions, classes, or modules.
