# Mission Brief: DSN Week {week}, {year}

## Objective

Schedule antenna time for Deep Space Network (DSN) communication requests to **minimize unsatisfied ratio** across all missions.

## Problem Statistics

- **Week**: {week} of {year}
- **Total Requests**: {n_requests}
- **Missions**: {n_missions}

## Key Metrics

Your schedule will be evaluated on two metrics:

| Metric | Description | Goal |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **U_max** | Maximum unsatisfied ratio across all missions | Lower is better |
| **U_rms** | Root mean square unsatisfied ratio | Lower is better |
| **U_avg** | Average unsatisfied ratio across all missions | Lower is better |

**Unsatisfied ratio** for a mission = `(requested_hours - allocated_hours) / requested_hours`

A perfect schedule has U_max = 0 (all requests fully satisfied).

## Getting Started

1. Use `list_unsatisfied_requests()` to see what needs scheduling
2. Use `find_view_periods(request_id)` to find available slots
3. Use `schedule_track(request_id, antenna, trx_on, trx_off)` to allocate time
4. Use `get_plan_status()` to check your progress
5. When done, call `commit_plan()` to save your schedule

Good luck!
