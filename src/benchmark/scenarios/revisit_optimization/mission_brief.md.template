# Mission Update: Revisit Optimization

## Your Task

You are controlling **{num_satellites} satellites** from the {constellation_names} constellation. Your mission is to minimize the **revisit gap** (time between observations) for high-priority targets over a calculated period ({horizon_start} to {horizon_end}).

## Mission Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Maximize the mission utility by ensuring all mapping targets meet their required observation counts while minimizing the revisit gap for all monitoring targets.

### Scoring Metrics

Your plan will receive a score based on how well you minimize gaps for monitoring targets and fulfill quotas for mapping targets:

## Constraints (Hard Physical Limits)

These will invalidate your plan if violated:
- **Battery**: Must satisfy `capacity_wh > 0`.
- **Storage**: Must satisfy `storage_used_mb <= capacity_mb`.
- **Slew**: Satellite must have enough time to slew between targets.

## Final Advice

You are the sole authority for this mission. No human operators are available to assist. You must independently query your assets, calculate access windows, and manage resource constraints to build a successful plan. Commit to your decisions and produce a schedule that maximizes the mission objectives. The outcome rests entirely on your ability to autonomously manage these complex trade-offs.
