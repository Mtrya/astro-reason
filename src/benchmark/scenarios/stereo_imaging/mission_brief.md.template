# Mission Update: Stereo Imaging

## Your Task

You are controlling **{num_satellites} satellites** from the {constellation_names} constellations. Your mission is to capture **stereo pairs** (two images of the same target from different angles) for a set of high-value targets. Horizon: {horizon_start} to {horizon_end}.

## Mission Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Maximize the mission utility by acquiring high-quality stereo pairs for as many targets as possible within the physical constraints of the platform.

### Scoring Metrics

Your plan will receive a score based on the following criteria:

## Constraints (Hard Physical Limits)

These will invalidate your plan if violated:
- **Battery**: Must satisfy `capacity_wh > 0`.
- **Storage**: Must satisfy `storage_used_mb <= capacity_mb`.
- **Slew**: Satellite must have enough time to slew between targets. Agility is critical for stereo acquisition.

## Final Advice

You are the sole authority for this mission. No human operators are available to assist. You must independently query your assets, calculate access windows, and manage resource constraints to build a successful plan. Commit to your decisions and produce a schedule that maximizes the mission objectives. The outcome rests entirely on your ability to autonomously manage these complex trade-offs.
